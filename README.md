# Micronaut + Kotlin

## Related Artice
> Future Work

## Overview
This repository aim to present, by example, some core concepts around Micronaut and Kotlin such as:
- Coroutines
- Inversion of Control (IoC)
- Non-Blocking HTTP
- HTTP Client/Server
- Exception Handler

Additionally, other concepts related to Software Engineering are addressed such as:
- Mapped Diagnostic Context (MDC)
- Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP)

## Strucutre
- `client-sample`: provides a HTTP client example to be consumed by `server-sample`
- `server-sample`: provides the concepts previously mentioned about Micronaut, Kotlin and general Software Engineering

# Run
To be able to run, just execute the following commands inside `server-sample` and `client-sample`:
```bash
mvn clean package
mvn exec:exec
```
> It's necessary to install Maven and Java >= 11. 
> Alterntively, it's possible to use an IDE to run the project.
